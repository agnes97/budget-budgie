*__Budget Budgie__ is a personal "pet" project to customise handling of household budget in an effective way.*

*Feel free to use it, but be aware that it also servers as a way to learn coding and therefore some features might end up sacrificing the best, fastest solutions in favor of trying out multiple/new approaches/proofs of concept.*

*Budgie has also been documenting my "junior software dev to be" learning curve for over a year and I am aware of some bad naming, architectural decisions and other almost-legacy-code I could do better now that I simply didn't have time to refactor yet. It might take time before I get to fixing bugs that don't "bug me that much" (pun intended) in my free time.*
